Overview
========

This is a Salt_ formula for making servers backup themselves up using
duplicity_. This script has been modified from the original to 
support multiple server configurations. This can be easily modified to
for grains. Essentially it creates a ``custom_backup`` script which is
similar to duplicity but which automatically passes several options to
duplicity so that you don't need to specify them (backup location, gpg
options, and so on).

So, for example, to restore file
``/one/two/three``::

    custom_backup restore --file-to-restore=one/two/three one/two/three

To restore to ``/var/tmp`` instead::

    custom_backup restore --file-to-restore=one/two/three /var/tmp/three

To restore as it was three days ago::

    custom_backup restore --time=3D --file-to-restore=one/two/three /var/tmp/three

Run ``custom_backup help`` and ``man duplicity`` for more options.

This Salt formula also sets up scheduled backups with cron.

the private and public keys somewhere in case of a complete system failure.
I'm using lastpass for this. 

You'll want to generate GPG keys first on each backup client; to do this run::

    gpg --gen-key

and answer the defaults (RSA and RSA, 2048 bits, does not expire; real
name "Backup for *hostname*"; email address "root@*hostname*"; no
comment; empty passphrase). Then, export these keys to files::

  gpg --export-secret-keys --armor root@$hostname >$hostname.key
  gpg --export --armor root@$hostname >$hostname.pub

Store these files somewhere secure in case of a total system failure.
I'm using LastPass for this. This version only requires the GPG key 
ID to be hosted in pillar rather than the private and public keys.

Parameters
----------

- ``gpg_pw``: The GPG private key passphrase, or the symmetric
  encryption password.
- ``target``: No default.
- ``target_pw``: The target password, if required.
- ``key_id``: Public key ID. Get this by running ``gpg --list-keys``
  on the backup client. The key is 8 digit alpha-numeric string
  on the pub line.
- ``source``: Default ``/``.
- ``verbosity``: Default 4. See also the
  ``remove_all_inc_of_but_n_full`` parameter below.
- ``full_if_older_than``: How often to do full backups; see the
  duplicity documentation for more information. Default 1M.
- ``remove_older_than``: Oldest backup to keep. See the duplicity
  remove-older-than parameter. Default two years.
- ``remove_all_inc_of_but_n_full``: Delete incremental sets of all
  backup sets that are older than the count:th last full backup; see
  the duplicity documentation for more information. Note: the related
  ``duplicity`` command is always run with verbosity=error, regardless
  what has been set in ``verbosity``. This is because at the usual
  verbosity=warning, on some machines, not understood exactly when, the
  command shows an apparently harmless message "No extraneous files
  found, nothing deleted in cleanup."
- ``includes_excludes``: Parameters to duplicity related with
  including and excluding things.
- ``extra_parms``: Extra parameters to duplicity.  If you backup with
  ssh and have not added the target host key to known_hosts, you might
  want to use ``--ssh-options="-oStrictHostKeyChecking=no"``.
- ``when_to_run``: A crontab specification of the time it should run;
  default ``0 4 * * *``, i.e. 4am daily.
- ``pre``, ``post``: Strings containing scripts to run before and
  after backup.

See ``pillar.example`` for an example.
